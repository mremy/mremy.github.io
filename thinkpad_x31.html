<h3>Thinkpad X31</h3>

No sound after Debian install (Wheezy on a Thinkpad X31):<br />
<br />
It's a minmal install, with xorg-server, xdm and awesome.<br />
All seems to be okay (/proc/asound/cards, kernel modules, irq, etc.)<br />
<br />
The solution was to initialize alsa:<br />
<code>
# alsactl init 0
</code>
<br />
As the sound card had id 0 (cat /proc/asound/cards). Sound was then ther.<br />
