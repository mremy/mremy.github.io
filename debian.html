<h3>ALSA install</h3>

ALSA: No sound after Debian install.<br />
This happened with Wheezy on a Thinkpad X31, a Thinkpad X61s: it's probably not Thinkpad related.<br />
<br />
It's a minimal install, with xorg-server, xdm, awesome and some others.<br />
All seems to be okay (/proc/asound/cards, kernel modules, irq, etc.)<br />
<br />
The solution was to initialize alsa:<br />
<code>
# alsactl init 0
</code>
<br />
As the sound card had id 0 (cat /proc/asound/cards). Sound was then there.<br />
I guess it will worth to try to add a lien in the post install script.<br />
