=head4 No sound after Debian install (Wheezy on a Thinkpad X31)

It's a minmal install, with xorg-server, xdm and awesome.
All seems to be okay (/proc/asound/cards, kernel modules, irq, etc.)

The solution was to initialize alsa:

# alsactl init 0

As the sound card had id 0 (cat /proc/asound/cards). Sound was then ther.
